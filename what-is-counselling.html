                The NHS defines counselling as a "talking therapy that involves a trained therapist listening to you and
                helping you find ways to deal with emotional issues."
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is counselling and why is it important?</h3>
            <p>
                Counselling, or 'therapy' as it is commonly known, falls under the umbrella term ‘talking therapies’ and
                allows people to discuss their problems and any difficult feelings they encounter in a safe,
                confidential environment. The term can mean different things to different people, but in general, it is
                a process people seek when they want to change something in their lives, or simply explore their
                thoughts and feelings in more depth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A counsellor, or therapist, is not there to sit you down and tell you what to do. Instead, they will
                encourage you to talk about what's bothering you in order to uncover any root causes and identify your
                specific ways of thinking. They may then look to create a plan of action to either help you reconcile
                your issues, or help you to find ways of coping.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
                What is the difference between counselling and therapy?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The terms 'counselling' and 'therapy' have become used interchangeably in recent years. As explained by
                the NHS, “Counselling is a talking therapy that involves a trained therapist listening to you and
                helping you find ways to deal with emotional issues. Sometimes, the term ‘counselling’ is used to refer
                to talking therapies in general, but counselling is also a type of therapy in its own right.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Though the terms are often used to mean the same thing, generally counsellors look at specific issues
                over a shorter time period, whilst therapists often go deeper, looking to uncover the root causes of
                experiences, and treatment often spans over a longer period of time. It is important to recognise,
                however, that it is common for counselling to be referred to as 'therapy' and vice-versa. Equally,
                counsellors may utilise elements of therapy and therapists may counsel.
