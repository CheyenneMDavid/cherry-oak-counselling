The drawn image, whilst conveying sincerity, it is more neutral, which allows the site user to see the process taking place without feeling that the image is making assumptions on them and what they may or may not be coming to counselling for.

### Testimonials

### The Footer
In the footer, at the bottom of each page, there is a badge with a number.
This number would be an official number which shows that the therapist is accredited by BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy)

 ![](assets/images/bacp.webp) The Accreditation badge also has a link which will take the user to the BACP website directory where they will be able to check the credentials of the therapist.

 Also in in the footer is a link to the privacy policy.  Both the link to the BACP and the Privacy Policy are available from all pages via the footer.
 
  ### What is Counselling
 From the navigation, the user with find will be taken to a page giving a breif description of what counselling is and the benefits in an article qwritten by Emily Whitton and published on the website "The Counselling Directory", which can be found [HERE](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/what-is-counselling.html)

 ### Contact Form
 The  third button on the navigation will take the user to the contact form, where they can leave there details if that's their preference.  This form is also accessible via a link in the address and map area on the landing page.
 
 ### Features Left to Implement
 The Contact-Form requires attention.  its is happily responsive down to the resolutions of a Samsung Galaxy S9 and up to a resolution of 1920 x 1080.  But the japanese sand art background image doesn't work well with a tab S4.
